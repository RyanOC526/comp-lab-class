Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 0.5%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 71%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.3%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 %
